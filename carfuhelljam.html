    <h2>Car-Fu Helljam</h2>
    <p>Car-Fu Helljam is a hybrid car combat and skating game set in Scramble City, a futuristic utopian version of Sydney Australia in the year of 6969. Due to the invention of consciousness-safe-cloning, the entire population of earth is now conditionally immortal. Humanity has grown lax and carefree, and almost the entirety of the human experience now revolves around leisure. However, utopia is a fickle thing to manage. It is not a milestone that society simply needs to attain once, but instead an ongoing state that needs to be maintained. An increasing disregard for life and limb has caused cloning resources to run thin, and humanity's ever-increasing list of newly invented hobbies and pastimes contains more and more blood-sports by the minute. At the heart of this lies Car-Fu, an underground motor sport in which practicioners drive haunted monster trucks in style competitions and battle. The Car-Fu community is divided between passionate motor artists and uncaring daredevils, both of whom fiercely compete with each other to decide the reuptation of their artform. The very future of underground art in Scramble City is uncertain, but only one thing is known: The future will be decided in the underworld itself, at the Hell Jam Tournament. </p>
    <h3>Inspirations:</h3>
    <p>Car-Fu Helljam belongs to the Grind Fiction genre, and is artistically inspired by media like Jet Set Radio, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, The World Ends With You, Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt, and the art of Jamie Hewlett. The immortality-related parts of the storyline are inspired by works of speculative fiction like 17776 by Jon Bois, and the End Of Death SCP Canon.</p>
    <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
    <p>Gameplay will involve skating (in cars) to accumulate points via performing tricks, highly mobile combat (in cars), acrobatic racing (in cars), traversing a dense and lively futuristic Sydney (in cars or on foot if you want), collecting parts and weapons to customize your car in cartoonish and unrealistic ways, character customization, and a story mode. </p>
